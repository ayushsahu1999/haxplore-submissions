This project is about reducing ambulance commute time , by making an ambulance alert system. In this we implemented google api's to calculate position of ambulance when emergency system is on and accordingly we notify vehicles around it with gps to alert them beforehand, so they can adjust and giv a save passage to the ambulance in the side provided by the the notification, this will create a passage on one side of the road without any confusion or noise.This will directly reduce the commute time of patient. We also implemented a reassurance system i.e smart contract ,by which we recheck and verify if the ambulance which is not on duty don't use this system and cause problems to public.
